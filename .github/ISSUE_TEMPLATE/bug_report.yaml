      label: Logs
      description: |
        If your bug includes a crash, please use include logs in your issue.

        To capture logs, you can use `adb logcat`, or, if you have root access on your device or installed [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app), you can use a logger of your choice, for example: [LogFox](https://github.com/F0x1d/LogFox) to record logs.
        If you can, please filter on ViMusic (`it.vfsfitvnm.vimusic`/`it.vfsfitvnm.vimusic.nightly`) to unclutter the logs a bit.

        When submitting these logs here, please upload them as a file or upload them on [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/). This way the issue ticket won't end up looking like a total mess.
